# QuestionsBox

A toolkit for surveyors to build multi-faceted surveys. The toolset (eventually) includes all question types conceivable, with openness to add new ones on request, while also allowing complex branching and conditional presentation.

This toolkit is meant to be plugged into a user defined User/Surveytaker class.

_Goals for future updates_
* _Implement the first question type and handling_
* _Figure out how to create migrations for the users of this gem to use in implementing the question models_
* _Eventually, allow admins to create qualifying recipes for simpler tracking of qualified Users/Surveytakers_

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'questions_box'
